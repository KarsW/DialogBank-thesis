UPDATE DECEMBER 14 2016 - 

A new program (executable/.exe file) is now available that allows for the TabSW to XML conversion - without the need for python (Windows systems only). Download from https://www.dropbox.com/s/508ydrxr4tn9i5d/TabSW%20to%20XML%20Converter.zip?dl=0

Download the zip file ('TabSW to XML Converter.zip') --> unzip the .exe file anywhere you want --> open the .exe file --> 
provide 1) the path the the annotation file (.xlsx), 2) the path to the tokenization file (.txt), 3) the path to the segmentation file (.txt)
The XML output file will be stored in the same folder that contains the .exe file.

Use an online formatter (for example) such as http://www.webtoolkitonline.com/xml-formatter.html 
or open the file in a web browser so that the XML file contains Tabs.
