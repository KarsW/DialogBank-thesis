UPDATE DECEMBER 14 2016 - 

A new program (executable/.exe file) is now available that allows for the TabSW to XML conversion - without the need for python.
Download the zip file ('TabSW to XML Converter.zip') --> unzip the .exe file anywhere you want --> open the .exe file --> 
provide 1) the path the the annotation file (.xlsx), 2) the path to the tokenization file (.txt), 3) the path to the segmentation file (.txt)
The XML output file will be stored in the same folder that contains the .exe file.

Use an online formatter (for example) such as http://www.webtoolkitonline.com/xml-formatter.html 
or open the file in a web browser so that the XML file contains Tabs.


SEPTEMBER 2016 -

- The file 'db_conversion_main.py' contains the Python script of the main conversion program that allows for conversions between the DiAML-XML, DiAML-MultiTab, and DiAML-TabSW ISO 24617-2 representation formats.
- The file 'db_conversion_second.py' contains the Python script of the conversion program that allows for conversions between Map Task and DBOX DiAML-XML annotations into slightly adjusted DiAML-MultiTab and DiAML-TabSW representations.
- Currently, both scripts can be run in any Pyhton interpreter. In the near future the script may be updated so that more options are available.
    
- The file 'formal sw00-0004.docx'contains a formal version of the complete Switchboard dialogue 'sw00-0004'
