SEPTEMBER 2016 - OLD (Newer Converters available, see above)

- The file 'db_conversion_main.py' contains the Python script of the main conversion program that allows for conversions between the DiAML-XML, DiAML-MultiTab, and DiAML-TabSW ISO 24617-2 representation formats.
- The file 'db_conversion_second.py' contains the Python script of the conversion program that allows for conversions between Map Task and DBOX DiAML-XML annotations into slightly adjusted DiAML-MultiTab and DiAML-TabSW representations.
- Currently, both scripts can be run in any Pyhton interpreter. In the near future the script may be updated so that more options are available.
    
- The file 'formal sw00-0004.docx'contains a formal version of the complete Switchboard dialogue 'sw00-0004'
